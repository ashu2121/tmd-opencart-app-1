This extension works with almost any shipping methodThe setting of Delivery Date And Time Slot For Order1. Disable Date & TimeAn admin has the full right to enable or disable this module. On certain occasions; an admin can completely disable the delivery date from setting during a particular day or for days.This will ensure your audience will not be able to use the module for a required delivery date and provide a smooth and effective transition of goods from your store to your customers without any chaos.2. Admin has full control to Manage Delivery Date and Time SlotAdmin can use the general setting to activate or deactivate either date or time or both and control delivery dates available on your store.

Use of Admin Time Slots instead of Time PickerThere are two kinds of time slots featured in this TMD Delivery Date/Time Checkout Module; They areTime PickerAdmin Time SlotsIn point number 4 above you can see customer can use their own delivery date and time so this is particularly true when you set Time Picker as your default delivery date and time.However; the admin can set up his own time slot instead of Time Picker.so this will allow your business to overlap the time that your business is comfortable with instead of providing customers to use their own time and date of delivery.6.
